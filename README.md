# NLP_MAS_Project_DL_Chatbot

My purpose is to implement a  conversional agent (chatbot) that includes a part of Deep Learning that should improve  
significantly the performance of  the chatbot in  answerring questions. The project will be implemented using python and
will include a GUI allowing the interaction User-Bot. 
The project will be composed at least of a json file ,  which will store the possible questions ( pattern), and the answers 
which will be used to train the model (that will be composed at least by 200/250 possible questions), a class to implement 
the GUI, a class to manipulate the data, a class to implement an appropriate NN.
